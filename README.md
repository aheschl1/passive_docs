# Documentation Agent

I do not like writing docstring comments, but one of my repos has gootten so big that I forget how it works in places. So, this agent should do it for me with nightly PRs to GitHub. Sweet.

Yes, my `.env` is in the repo. There is nothing there, except the endpoint to my VPNs Ollama.
